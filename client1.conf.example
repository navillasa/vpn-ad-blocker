# Example WireGuard Client Config
# Replace the placeholder keys and IPs

# You can generate the client keys like this...
# Generate private key
# wg genkey > client_private.key

# Generate public key
# wg pubkey < client_private.key > client_public.key

[Interface]
PrivateKey = CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY

# The IP address assigned to this client inside the VPN network
Address = 10.0.0.2/32

# DNS server used while connected to VPN (pointing to your VPS running AdGuard Home)
DNS = VPS_IP

[Peer]
# Public key of your VPN server (from /etc/wireguard/server_public.key)
PublicKey = SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY

# VPS IP and WireGuard listening port
Endpoint = VPS_IP:51820

# Allowed IPs define what traffic goes through the VPN
# 0.0.0.0/0 means all traffic is routed through VPN (full tunnel)
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0

# Keeps the connection alive behind NAT/firewalls
PersistentKeepalive = 25
