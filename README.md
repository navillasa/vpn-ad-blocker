## So Far...
- Provisioned VPS on Hetzner CX21, Ubuntu 24.04
- Installed & configured WireGuard for secure VPN access
- Installed & configured AdGuard Home for DNS-level ad blocking
- Configured UFW to secure server and allow necessary traffic
- Set up VPN client config for easy connection from devices

## Scripts
This repo includes helper scripts to speed up provisioning and client setup.

### `setup.sh`

Installs and configures WireGuard and AdGuard Home.  
Run this on your VPS:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/navillasa/vpn-ad-blocker/main/setup.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh
```

### `add-client.sh`

Generates a new WireGuard config for an additional client device (e.g. laptop or phone).

If `qrencode` is installed, it also prints a QR code to scan from the WireGuard mobile app.

```bash
chmod +x add-client.sh
sudo ./add-client.sh clientname
```
The config will be in ./clients/clientname.conf, and you can scan the QR code directly into the WireGuard mobile app:

1. Open the WireGuard app
2. Tap +
3. Choose "Scan from QR code"
